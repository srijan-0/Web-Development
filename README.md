# Web-Development
This is my web development project built using vite-react as frontened and java spring boot as backend.

Project run process
- Open my frontened folder i.e my-react-app  in visual studio code
    - npm install
    - npm run dev

- open backened folder in intellij  IDEA 
    - click on the run button 

In order to start the project both frontened and backend server should be run
